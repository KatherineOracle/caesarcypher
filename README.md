# caesarcypher
Task 11 - Capstone Project II: Arrays, functions and string handling

In this task, we created a Caesar cypher to write up secret messages where we used an algorithm to make one letter represent another letter! Example below:

![Caesar Cypher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg/1280px-Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg.png)

This cypher uses the 15th letter after the letter you want to use. For example, ‘a’ will be ‘p’. Bear in mind that the letters are treated as cyclical. That means that ‘p’ will be coded to ‘e’ (the 10th letter after ‘p’ is ‘z’, so 5 letters after that will be ‘e’ because the cycle starts again).

## Installation
To install simply download the files cypher.js and index.html to your local PC

## Usage
* Run index.html
* The prompt will ask if you want to encode or decode (e or d). 
* Select encode (e) first and type a human-readable English string.
* Open the console to see the result
* To test it copy the encoded string from the console and refresh the page
* Select "d" and enter the encoded string. 
* View the console to see the encoded string converted back to your original message

## Credits
* This solution was built by Katherine Van As with JavaScript
* Thank you to HyperionDev for this excellent exercise
